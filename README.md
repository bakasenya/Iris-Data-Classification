This repository contains a classification and visualization analysis of the famous Iris dataset. The dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers categorized into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The project involves data visualization and training various machine learning models for classification.

Features-
  Data exploration and visualization
  Classification using Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LogReg), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  Performance evaluation of models

Dataset-
The dataset contains the following features:
